# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection (RetinaCare)

**About:**
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection, or RetinaCare, is an AI-driven solution aimed at identifying diabetic retinopathy, a critical complication of diabetes, using retinal images. Our project offers a non-invasive, accessible, and efficient tool to assess the severity of this condition.

**Problem We Solve:**
- Early detection of diabetic retinopathy.
- Preventing vision loss in diabetic patients.

**Why Use Our Model:**
Our model provides:
- Quick, accurate diagnosis of retinopathy.
- Early intervention for effective treatment.
- Personalized recommendations based on severity.

**How It Addresses Real-World Problems:**
- Non-invasive, accessible eye health assessment.
- Timely intervention to reduce vision loss risk.
- Aiding both patients and healthcare professionals.

**Motivation:**
We're motivated by the desire to improve public health, especially for those with diabetes, and to combat vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Machine Learning: PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
